# This is GeneSharp

Right now this is the most basic version of a genetic algorithm you can find. I plan to create a library with Variable Length Chromosomes, but right now it's only fixed length.

# How to run it
You can't. But you can star it and I'll let you know. 

# The docs suck!
I know. It'll be fixed as soon as I do some work on the project to actually worth writing a doc for it
