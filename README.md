# This is GeneSharp
Right now this is the most basic version of a genetic algorithm you can find.
I plan to create a library with Variable Length Chromosomes, but right now it's only fixed length.

# How to run it
Just fork the repo or clone it and you can run it just fine. Right now, there's only one project that exists in samples but there should be more in the future! Star it and stay tuned!

# Where are the docs?
While I have plans to write some docs when the project gets bigger, right now you'll have to make do with the source code.
